# Wixoss-TCG-Cockatrice-Plugin

Welcome, and thank you for downloading this package for Wixoss TCG. This download contains everything you need to add this game to your Cockatrice program, along with some extra files to help newer players ease themselves into this amazing game.

**First, a disclaimer:**

I do not own anything related to the Wixoss franchise, including its anime series, trading card game, manga, and any other form of product or service. This is a package containing information that is readily available through multiple public sources on the internet. Everything included here is done without profit and solely to help bring personal enjoyment and spread awareness of the great game that is Wixoss TCG.

**Now, letâ€™s help you add this game to [Cockatrice](https://cockatrice.github.io/):**

1. Open your Cockatrice program, then proceed to download its first database for MTG.

2. Restart the program, then go to (Card Database -> Open Custom Sets folder).  This should take you to Cockatrice's customsets folder found in your user's AppData folder.  

3. Move back a folder from the customsets folder.  You should then see the customsets folder itself along with a number of other folders, including ones named pics and themes.

4. Move the customsets, pics, and themes folders from this download into that Cockatrice folder.  If it asks you if you want to merge the contents, say yes.

5. Restart the Cockatrice program.  Once the program reloads, it should notify you of new sets being added to it and will ask if you want to enable those sets.  Say yes.

6. Go to (Card Database -> Manage Sets) then press the OK button.  This should refresh the kinds of entries that will appear in the main list of cards on the left side of the window.

7. If you see a number of Wixoss TCG cards show up on that menu, then you have successfully added Wixoss to Cockatrice.  I hope you enjoy the game!


-- **OPTIONAL:  Safely removing sets/cards from MTG/other TCGs from the card list menu** --

**Quick and easy way before moving files**: 
1. Before moving the download's customsets folder into Cockatrice's customsets folder for merging, go open the Cockatrice program itself if it isn't open already, then enter (Card Database -> Manage Sets). There should be a large lists of sets that are enabled from MTG and other custom games you have added to Cockatrice.

2. Hit "Disable all", then re-enable a single set from the menu by clicking its checkmark.  Memorize the name of the set you re-enable.

3. Now you can merge the customsets folder as mentioned before on #4 in the main directions above.

4. Restart Cockatrice, then say yes to the prompt that will show up for the new Wixoss TCG setfile you added.

5. Enter (Card Database -> Manage Sets) again, and disable the one set you kept enabled in #2. Now the only cards that should show up on the program are Wixoss TCG cards!

**Slightly less convenient way if the files were already moved**
This method is best for completely removing the MTG database from Cockatrice.  Go with this method if you have no plans to play MTG.

1. If the folders referenced in #4 in the main directions were already merged, move the cards.xml file that is seen next to all those folders to a different location on your computer. Or just delete the file, that's up to you.

2. Move the Wixoss TCG.xml file that is in Cockatrice's customsets folder into the original location of the cards.xml file before you moved/deleted it.

3. Rename the Wixoss TCG.xml file to cards.xml

4. Restart Cockatrice, and now the program will treat your Wixoss TCG file as the main database for the program, with the original cards.xml out of sight!

4a. For future updates, rename the updated Wixoss TCG.xml from the new download to cards.xml, then replace the old one you had in the Cockatrice before.

-- **OPTIONAL:  Change the theme to the Wixoss TCG theme** --

After successfully following through the previous steps above, go to (Cockatrice -> Settings -> Appearance). There should be a dropdown menu among its options there that will let you change the in-client theme to the Wixoss theme, featuring the game's main deck card back and a hand icon along with it.

-- **Some useful functions to help operate Wixoss TCG on Cockatrice** --

- Placing cards face-down on the field from anywhere is an important mechanic for this game. To do this, hold the Shift key, then click and drag the card to wherever the card needs to be. For instance, to setup your 7 cards in your Life Cloth, hold Shift and click+drag the top card of your deck to the bottom row of your board seven times, making sure all the cards are stacked from left to right in order. Facedown cards are also numbered on the field, so take advantage of that when ordering your Life Cloth stack correctly for all players involved.

- Adding a card to your Ener Zone is quick and easy for the cards in your hand. Just double click any card in your hand to directly send it to the vertical zone on the board. This area will be treated as your Ener Zone.

-  Wixoss TCG is a game that uses 2 separate decks: the main deck and the LRIG Deck. The LRIG deck is accessed by looking at your sideboard ingame through pressing Ctrl+F3. Double click any card in the LRIG deck to directly place it on the bottom row of your field. When a card is to return to the LRIG deck for any reason, open up the sideboard window and drag the specific card back into that window.

-  Adding cards to your LRIG Deck in the Deck Edit screen is done by holding the Ctrl button then adding the card through your regular means. This will display as if it was added to the sideboard, but 

-  Wixoss TCG deckbuilding rules require the main deck to have exactly 20 cards with the [Life Burst] ability on them. Cockatrice does not have a function that can keep track of this for you when building your deck, so you have to count your cards correctly as you build your decks.

-  Any other functions that you may need to help play Wixoss TCG on Cockatrice can be found by right-clicking a card or empty area on the field or any zone available to you.
